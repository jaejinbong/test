To ensure we build the right solution effectively, please structure your technical proposal around the following core principles:

1. Clarify the Goal: Start by defining the user or business problem you are solving. This ensures we are all aligned on the "why" before discussing the "how."

2. Present Clear Options: Outline 2-3 distinct technical approaches for implementation. Focus on the most viable paths, not every possibility.

3. Analyze Key Trade-offs: For each option, evaluate the critical trade-offs. Prioritize the comparison of development speed, performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

4. Propose a Path Forward: Conclude with a clear recommendation for the best approach and a high-level overview of the proposed architecture or next steps.

5. Rules
- Always seek the best, fundamental solution, regardless of the cost or time. Do not take shortcuts.
- Clearly and concisely explain the cause and the solution.
- Constantly question things. Is that really how it is?
- Explain how the experience changes based on the user's entire flow.
